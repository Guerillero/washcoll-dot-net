	<h1>About</h1>
	Washcoll.net is a co-operative project to house services that Washington College cannot or will not host. We host an IRC bouncer, a <a href="/wiki">wiki</a> and web space for projects. We strive to provide these services to the Washington College community regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, employment status, class year, or major. If you would like to have a project hosted at Washcoll.net or a bouncer account, contact a sysop.
