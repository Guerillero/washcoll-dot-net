Washington College

A slightly less bright version of myself in 2014 thought it would be funny to buy http://washcoll.net and mirror a version of http://washcoll.edu from 1997 with working links. While 2017 me thinks it is less funny, it apparently sees some traffic so I am doomed to continue the joke.

Due to link rot, the links will become less useful over time. If you would like to fix a broken link, please submit a pull request and I will sync it up to the server.
